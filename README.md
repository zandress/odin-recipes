# odin-recipes

This project consists of building a simple HTML index page that will have links
to a few recipes. 

This project will help build my knowledge of HTML and use Git commands to commit changes to GitHub.
I will link to other HTML files from the main index page.
A few HTML tags I will use include:
    *Unordered Lists
    *Ordered Lists
    *Links
    *Img Tags
    *Heading Tags
I will also will be viewing my project on the web via GitHub.

Update 11/26/21
