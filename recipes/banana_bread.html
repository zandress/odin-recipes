<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This banana bread has been the most popular recipe on Simply Recipes for over 10 years. 
<br>Thousands of people make it every day. Why?<br>
Because it really is the best banana bread recipe, period. 
You can mix everything in one bowl, <br>you can vary the amount of sugar or bananas. 
And the secret to its great flavor? <strong>Melted butter</strong>.</p>
<p>The beauty of this banana bread recipe is you don't need a fancy mixer! A mixing bowl, 
<br>a fork to whisk the eggs and a sturdy spoon to mix the batter are all you need. 
<br>The sugar amount is flexible. The original recipe called for a cup of white sugar, but most people, 
<br>including me, do just fine with 3/4 of a cup, and many are happy with a 1/2 cup.
<br><br>You can toss in a cup of chopped nuts, raisins, or chocolate chips if you want, or put the batter 
<br>into muffin tins and make banana nut muffins instead. You can even go a step further 
<br>and make chocolate banana bread.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 to 3 medium (7" to 7-7/8" long) very ripe bananas, 
        <br>peeled (about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups mashed)</li>
    <li>1/3 cup (76g) butter, unsalted or salted, melted</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    <li>3/4 cup (150g) sugar (1/2 cup if you would like 
        <br>it less sweet, 1 cup if more sweet)</li>
    <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups (205g) all-purpose flour</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350째F (175째C), and butter a 4x8-inch loaf pan.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth. 
        <br>Stir the melted butter into the mashed bananas.

    </li>
    <li>Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. <br>Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour 
        at 350째F (175째C), or until a toothpick or wooden <br>skewer inserted into the 
        center comes out clean. A few dry crumbs are okay; <br>streaks of wet batter 
        are not. If the outside of the loaf is browned but the center <br>is still 
        wet, loosely tent the loaf with foil and continue baking until the loaf 
        is fully baked..

    </li>
    <li>Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove 
        the banana <br>bread from the pan and let cool completely before serving. 
        Slice and serve. <br>(A bread knife helps to make slices that aren't crumbly.)
        Wrapped well, the banana bread <br>will keep at room temperature for 4 days. 
        For longer storage, refrigerate the loaf up to <br>5 days, or freeze it.
