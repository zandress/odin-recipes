        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking 
                <br>pan with parchment paper and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl mix flour, baking soda, 
                <br>salt, baking powder. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Cream together butter and sugars until combined.</li>
            <li>Beat in eggs and vanilla until fluffy.</li>
            <li>Mix in the dry ingredients until combined.</li>
            <li>Add 12 oz package of chocolate chips 
                and <br>mix well.</li>
            <li>Roll 2-3 TBS (depending on how large you like 
                <br>your cookies) of dough at a time into balls and 
                <br>place them evenly spaced on your prepared cookie 
                <br>sheets. (alternately, use a small cookie scoop

                <br>before removing to cooling rack.</li>
