            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, (spooned and leveled)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, or vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Assorted toppings, such as butter, maple syrup,

            <br>whipped cream, or chocolate syrup</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="margin-left: 40px;">Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees; have a baking sheet or 
                heatproof <br>platter ready to keep cooked pancakes warm 
                in the oven. <br>In a small bowl, whisk together flour, 
                sugar, baking powder, <br>and salt; set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, butter (or oil), 
                and egg. <br>Add dry ingredients to milk mixture; whisk 
                until just moistened <br>(do not overmix; a few small 
                lumps are fine).</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet (nonstick or cast-iron) or griddle 
                over medium. <br>Fold a sheet of paper towel in half, and 
                moisten with oil; carefully <br>rub skillet with 
                oiled paper towel.</li>
            <li>For each pancake, spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter 
                onto skillet, <br>using the back of the spoon to spread 
                batter into a round <br>(you should be able to fit 2 to 
                3 in a large skillet).</li>
            <li>Cook until surface of pancakes have some bubbles 
                and a few <br>have burst, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip carefully 
                with a thin spatula, <br>and cook until browned on the 
                underside, 1 to 2 minutes more. <br>Transfer to a baking 
                sheet or platter; cover loosely with aluminum <br>foil, 
                and keep warm in oven. Continue with more oil and 
                remaining <br>batter. (You'll have 12 to 15 pancakes.) 
                <br>Serve warm, with desired toppings.</li>
